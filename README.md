# CEIS299_PythonCert
This repository is for my CEIS299 class where I am learning the basic's of Python for my Microsoft Python Certification.
I Love to read, write, Design, and Code. I also, love cuddling with my husband & my furbabies (A puppy & Cat) at night while we watch TV or play video games together.
